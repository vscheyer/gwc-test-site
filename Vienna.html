   <p><center>Our goal for this project was to design a low cost, yet functional and durable, transradial prosthetic arm meant to replace the forearm of someone who has suffered paralysis or amputation. </center></p>
   <p><center>Here is the arm:</center></p>

   <p><center>You might think the arm looks too crude for it to be of any use. The reason for this is that we focused on keeping the cost as low as possible (the materials cost about $50 total) and we wanted the arm to be easily repairable (that's why the hardware is accessible) so that the patient could fix their own prosthesis in the absence of medical care.</center></p>
