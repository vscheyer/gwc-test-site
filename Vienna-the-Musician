    <h1>Fiddler ~ Bagpiper</h1>
    <p>I am based in the Seattle area, and I am available for hire to play at your special event! I have played the fiddle for nearly 12 years, and this is my fourth year playing the bagpipes. I play with the Northwest Scottish Fiddlesr and the Northwest Junior Pipe Band.</p>
